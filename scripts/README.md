Some Scripts
============

### comments.sh

`comments.sh` - it's used to generate author and problem description comments 

> **Notes**: 
> - The  `comments.sh`  is compatible for both Linux and Mac platfrom.
> - The  `comments.sh`  needs [xidel](https://github.com/benibela/xidel) to grab & parse the html  contents with filtering out the HTML tags. The script  would check the `xidel`  whether installed or not in your Linux box, if not, it will download via Github on Linux platform, and the run `brew install xidel` on Mac platfrom.
> - The  `comments.sh`  currently can automatically detect the problem's type, if the problem is `algorithm` type, it's going to create `.cpp` file, if the problem is `shell` type, the `.sh` file will be created.

1) Create a file named largestNumber.cpp, and add Copyright & Problem description
```
./comments.sh https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/
```

2) Add Copyright & Problem description into existed file
```
./comments.sh https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/ largestNumber.cpp
```

The comments would be generated by above examples as below:

> **Notes**
> If you need to customize the `Author` name, you have to change the `$AUTHOR` variable at the beginning of the scripts.

/**********************************************************************************
 *
 * Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
 *
 * For example, given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.
 *
 * Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
 *
 * Credits:Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

### readme.sh

`readme.sh` - it's used to generate the table item in README.md

For example:

```
$  ./readme.sh ../algorithms/cpp/nextPermutation/nextPermutation.cpp 
|31|[Next Permutation](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/) | [C++](./algorithms/cpp/nextPermutation/nextPermutation.cpp)|Medium|
```
